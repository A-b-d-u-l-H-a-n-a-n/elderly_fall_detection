# Elderly Fall Detection
Overview

This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting falls in elderly individuals. The project leverages various classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to analyze sensor data. The goal is to enhance safety and preventative care through early fall detection.
Dataset

The model uses a dataset named cStick.csv, which includes the following features:

    Distance: Distance moved by the individual.
    Pressure: Pressure detected by the sensor.
    HRV: Heart Rate Variability.
    Sugar level: Blood sugar level.
    SpO2: Blood oxygen saturation level.
    Accelerometer: Motion detection data.
    Outcome: Target variable representing the status ('No Fall detected', 'Slip detected', 'Definite fall').

Technologies Used

    Python
        Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Google Colab for running the notebook and accessing the dataset.

Code Structure

    Importing Libraries: Essential libraries for data manipulation and model evaluation.
    Mounting Google Drive: Access to dataset stored in the user's Google Drive.
    Data Preprocessing: Loading the dataset, defining features, and converting data types.
    Model Training and Validation:
        SVM: Cross-validation and evaluation of the SVM model.
        Logistic Regression: Training and evaluation of the logistic regression model.
        Random Forest: Random forest model building and hyperparameter tuning.
    Predictive Function: Function to make predictions based on input features.
    Results Visualization: Plotting confusion matrices and comparing model accuracies.

How to Run the Code

    Open the notebook in Google Colab or a local Jupyter Notebook environment.
    Ensure the dataset cStick.csv is accessible in your Google Drive.
    Run each cell sequentially, ensuring that all necessary libraries are installed.

Example Usage

You can use the predictive function as follows:
python
Copy

decision = predictive_model([Distance, Pressure, HRV, Sugar Level, SpO2, Accelerometer], clf_RF)
print(f'The prediction is: "{decision}"')

Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Results

Confusion matrices and accuracy comparisons are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn, allowing for easy insights into model performance.
